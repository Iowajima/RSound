Documentation: librsound
===========================

This document will give the developer an insight in the functions that librsound provides, together with proper use.

Library: The main implementation of the RSound protocol is the C library that is included in the RSound package.


Structs:

librsound uses one opaque type for all its function calls.

typedef struct rsound rsound_t;

For certain types of applications of librsound, it might be useful to peek into the struct. To get the rsound_t struct exposed, #define RSD_EXPOSE_STRUCT before including <rsound.h>. Try to avoid doing this, as ABI compability is not guaranteed between different versions.


Return values:

librsound uses the POSIX standard return value scheme with 0 (or positive number) for success, and negative return value for error.
librsound does not however use errno or similar. Exceptions to this will be noted. 
Do note that functions which return with unsigned types like size_t will generally return with 0 as error.
Errors must always be checked for even if the example code below doesn't do so! They are avoided for code clarity.


Style:

librsound will seem somewhat familiar to those who have developed for OSS (Open Sound System) and libAO.
It is a blocking I/O audio library, but supports features for non-blocking situations.


Typedefs:

typedef ssize_t (*rsd_audio_callback_t)(void *out_data, size_t bytes, void *userdata);
typedef void (*rsd_error_callback_t)(void *userdata);


Function calls:

All librsound calls are named with rsd_*.


int rsd_init(rsound_t** handle);
int rsd_simple_start(rsound_t** handle, const char* host, const char* port, const char* ident, int rate, int channels, enum rsd_format format);
int rsd_set_param(rsound_t* handle, enum rsd_settings option, void* param);
void rsd_set_callback(rsound_t* handle, rsd_audio_callback_t audio_cb, rsd_error_callback_t err_cb, size_t max_size, void *userdata);
void rsd_callback_lock(rsound_t *handle);
void rsd_callback_unlock(rsound_t *handle);
void rsd_set_event_callback(rsound_t* handle, rsd_event_callback_t event_cb, void *userdata);
int rsd_start(rsound_t* handle);
int rsd_exec(rsound_t* handle);
int rsd_stop(rsound_t* handle);
size_t rsd_write(rsound_t* handle, const char* buf, size_t size);
size_t rsd_pointer(rsound_t* handle);
size_t rsd_get_avail(rsound_t* handle);
size_t rsd_delay(rsound_t* handle);
size_t rsd_delay_ms(rsound_t* handle);
int rsd_samplesize(rsound_t* handle);
void rsd_delay_wait(rsound_t* handle);
int rsd_pause(rsound_t* handle, int enable);
int rsd_free(rsound_t* handle);


=================================
int rsd_init(rsound_t** handle);
=================================

Params: A pointer to an rsound_t* struct.

Description: 
   Initializes an rsound stream.
   It should only fail if memory allocation failed.

Example code:

rsound_t* handle;
rsd_init(&handle);

Error handling has been omitted for clarity.


================================================================================================
int rsd_simple_start(rsound_t** handle, const char* host, const char* port, const char* ident, 
                     int rate, int channels, enum rsd_format format);
================================================================================================

Params:
   handle: Pointer to rsound_t* struct.
   host: host as set with RSD_HOST. Can be NULL.
   port: port as set with RSD_PORT. Can be NULL.
   ident: identity as set with RSD_IDENTITY. Can be NULL.
   rate: Audio sample rate. (RSD_SAMPLERATE)
   channels: Number of audio channels. (RSD_CHANNELS)
   format: Audio format. (RSD_FORMAT)

Description:
   Handles rsd_init(), rsd_set_params() and rsd_start() in one step. Should it error,
   it will make sure that no memory is leaked. The handle is considered uninitialized
   should this function fail. If it does not, a working connection is established.

Example code:
   rsound_t *handle;
   rsd_simple_start(&handle, "localhost", "12345", "simple player",
                     44100, 2, RSD_S16_NE);

Note: This is a newer function call. To check for support in your version, you can check
      for the macro definition #ifdef RSD_SIMPLE_START

============================================================================
int rsd_set_param(rsound_t* handle, enum rsd_settings option, void* param);
============================================================================

Parameters:
   handle: An initialized rsound_t handle.
   option: The parameter which is should be set.
   param: The parameter.

Description:
   This call is similar to ioctl() as found in POSIX.
   It sets options that are relevant to an audio stream.
   It will return -1 when invalid values are given in param.
   You must NOT call this function after rsd_start() has been called.
   RSD_LATENCY can however be called on at any time.
   You will have to call rsd_stop() first.

   Available options are defined in the rsd_settings enum.

   RSD_SAMPLERATE
   RSD_CHANNELS
   RSD_HOST
   RSD_PORT
   RSD_BUFSIZE
   RSD_LATENCY
   RSD_FORMAT
   RSD_IDENTITY


RSD_SAMPLERATE:
   This sets the samplerate of the audio stream. This is typically 44100 or 48000.
   You will need to set this parameter for each stream.

Example:
   int rate = 44100;
   rsd_set_param(handle, RSD_SAMPLERATE, &rate);


RSD_CHANNELS:
   Will set number of audio channels.
   You will need to set this parameter for each stream.

Example:
   int channels = 2;
   rsd_set_param(handle, RSD_CHANNELS, &channels);


RSD_HOST:
   Sets the server which librsound should connect to.
   If an absolute path is given, librsound will treat this as a Unix socket.
   Unless the user of your application explicitly asks you for a host, you should
   not use this. librsound defaults to the environmental variable RSD_SERVER, 
   and then to "localhost" should it not be set.

Example:
   char *server = "foo.bar.org";
   rsd_set_param(handle, RSD_HOST, server);

RSD_PORT:
   Used for TCP/IP conncetions. This sets the port that librsound should connect to.
   As with RSD_HOST, you should not use this unless the user explicitly asks the application.
   librsound defaults to the environmental variable RSD_PORT, 
   and then to port 12345 should it not be set.
   Note that RSD_PORT takes a char* in param, and not int*.

Example:
   char *port = "9600";
   rsd_set_param(handle, RSD_PORT, port);


RSD_BUFSIZE:
   librsound keeps an internal buffer for audio. The size of this buffer can be controlled with RSD_BUFSIZE.
   In general, you should not change this, as a low value for RSD_BUFSIZE will not necessarily give a very low latency
   since there are other buffers that create more latency. This call is useful when trying to emulate sound systems
   that use a fixed sized buffer.

Example:
   int bytes_in_buf = 10000;
   rsd_set_param(handle, RSD_BUFSIZE, &bytes_in_buf);


RSD_LATENCY:
   librsound can quite accurately measure audio latency, but if data is written all the time to the buffer, 
   the audio latency can quickly grow quite large. Note that this behaviour is not a problem to general audio 
   and video programs, but it might be an issue with other applications, most notably games. 
   Do not use this unless it's critical for your application.

   RSD_LATENCY doesn't directly guarantee a maximum audio latency. When you subsequently call on rsd_delay_wait(), 
   it will sleep until the desired latency has been obtained. By calling rsd_delay_wait() before each call to 
   rsd_write() you can effectively get your desired latency. 
   RSD_LATENCY takes an int* param with the desired latency in milliseconds.

Example:
   int ms = 200;
   rsd_set_param(handle, RSD_LATENCY, &ms);


RSD_FORMAT:
   This sets the sample format used by the subsequent calls to rsd_write(). If the format is invalid, param
   will be set to a valid format.

   librsound currently supports these formats:
   RSD_S32_LE - signed 32 bit, little-endian
   RSD_S32_BE - signed 32 bit, big-endian
   RSD_S32_NE - signed 32 bit, native-endian
   RSD_U32_LE - unsigned 32 bit, little-endian
   RSD_U32_BE - unsigned 32 bit, big-endian
   RSD_U32_NE - unsigned 32 bit, native-endian
   RSD_S16_LE - signed 16 bit, little-endian
   RSD_S16_BE - signed 16 bit, big-endian
   RSD_S16_NE - signed 16 bit, native-endian
   RSD_U16_LE - unsigned 16 bit, little-endian
   RSD_U16_BE - unsigned 16 bit, big-endian
   RSD_U16_NE - unsigned 16 bit, native-endian
   RSD_U8     - unsigned 8 bit
   RSD_S8     - signed 8 bit
   RSD_ALAW   - a-law
   RSD_MULAW  - mu-law

   librsound will default to RSD_S16_LE if this is never set, as this is the audio format that is generally used for music.

Example:
   int format = RSD_S16_NE;
   rsd_set_param(handle, RSD_FORMAT, &format);

Note:
   To check if a sample format is implemented in your version, you can check for #defines.

   E.g.:
   #ifdef RSD_S16_NE
   ... // do stuff
   #endif


RSD_IDENTITY:
   This sets an identity string associated with the stream. Often set to the name of the application itself, e.g. "CoolPlayer X"
   Should the length of the string be too long (~250 bytes), it will be truncated. Using this is not mandatory.

Example:
   char *name = "Test application";
   rsd_set_param(handle, RSD_IDENTITY, name);

Note:
   This is a new addition to the librsound API. To check if this is implemented in your version, you can check for a #define with:

   #ifdef RSD_IDENTITY
   ... // do stuff
   #endif
   
===========================================================================
void rsd_set_callback(rsound_t* handle, rsd_audio_callback_t callback, 
      rsd_error_callback_t err_callback, size_t max_size, void *userdata);
===========================================================================

Description:
   Enables use of the callback interface. This must be set when stream is not active. 
   Enabling error callback is not optional, as it is the only way to signal caller of errors that could occur.

   When callback is active, use of the blocking interface is disabled. 
   Only valid functions to call after rsd_start() is stopping the stream with either rsd_pause() or rsd_stop(),
   calling rsd_delay_*(),
   or restarting the stream should an error have occured.
   Calling any other function is undefined. 

   The callback is called at regular intervals and is asynchronous, so thread safety must be ensured by the caller. 
   The callback should return as fast as possible so try to avoid doing operations that may block for longer periods.
   If not enough data can be given to the callback, librsound may choose to fill the rest of the callback data with silence. 

   librsound will attempt to target the latency information given with RSD_LATENCY as given before calling rsd_start().

   max_size signifies the maximum size that will ever be requested by librsound in a single callback. 
   Set this to 0 to let librsound decide the maximum size.

   Should an error occur to the stream, err_callback will be called, and the stream will be stopped. 
   The stream can be started again with rsd_start().

   The callback can be disabled when a stream is not running by setting both callbacks to NULL.

Example:
   rsound_t *handle;
   rsd_init(&handle);

   ... // Set some params

   rsd_set_callback(handle, callback, err_callback, 0, userdata);

   rsd_start(handle);
   ... // Let magic happen in the callback.

   rsd_stop(handle);

   // Disable callback here and go back to blocking API.
   rsd_set_callback(handle, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL);
   rsd_start(handle);

   // Write stuff normally.
   rsd_write(handle, buffer, size);

   rsd_stop(handle);
   rsd_free(handle);

Note:
   This is a new addition to the librsound API. To check if this is implemented in your version, you can check for a #define with:

   #ifdef RSD_SET_CALLBACK
   ... // do stuff
   #endif


===========================================
void rsd_callback_lock(rsound_t *handle);
===========================================

Description:
   Aquire the lock to the callback function. While this lock is held, the callback is guaranteed to not be in execution.
   Attempting to aquire this lock when already locked in the same thread could lead to a deadlock.

Example:
   rsd_callback_lock(handle);
   ... // Push data safely to a buffer that is drained by the callback later.
   rsd_callback_unlock(handle);

Note:
   This is a new addition to the librsound API. To check if this is implemented in your version, you can check for a #define with:

   #ifdef RSD_CALLBACK_LOCK
   ... // Do stuff
   #endif


===========================================
void rsd_callback_unlock(rsound_t *handle);
===========================================

Description:
   Release the lock to the callback function. See description on rsd_callback_lock() for usage.

Note:
   This is a new addition to the librsound API. To check if this is implemented in your version, you can check for a #define with:

   #ifdef RSD_CALLBACK_UNLOCK
   ... // Do stuff
   #endif

==============================================================================================
void rsd_set_event_callback(rsound_t* handle, rsd_event_callback_t event_cb, void *userdata);
==============================================================================================

Description:
   Sets the event callback. It will be called every time audio has been consumed internally.
   The callback will be disabled when callback audio mode is used.
   This function must be called when stream is not active.
   After the callback returns, audio is available to be written in a nonblocking fashion.
   It is not legal to call any rsound functions inside this callback.

Note:
   This is a new addition to the librsound API. To check if this is implemented in your version, you can check for a #define with:

   #ifdef RSD_SET_EVENT_CALLBACK
   ... // Do stuff
   #endif

===================================
int rsd_start(rsound_t* handle);
===================================

Description: 
   Connects to rsound server. 
   This is called after all desired parameters for rsd_set_param() have been set.
   This might fail if no connection can be establish, or there is some other network error. 
   Should it fail, you could change parameters and call rsd_start() another time.

Example:
rsd_start(handle);



==================================
int rsd_exec(rsound_t* handle);
==================================

Description:
   This function call will free the rsound structure given in handle and return the file descriptor used by the data stream.
   If the stream has not already been started, rsd_start() will be called.
   The handle must not be used after calling this function if this call succeeds.
   The returned socket will be blocking.
   This call will block until all internal buffers have been written to the network.
   This function call might be more useful on Unix systems as sockets are general file descriptors, while Win32 sockets are not.
   Win32 systems will need to use send() on sockets. This could be useful when going over the internet, as there is no protocol overhead at all.

Errors:
   Should rsd_exec() return a negative number, this will indicate that either rsd_start() failed or the request could not be honored.
   Should this happen, the data structure will not be freed, and it will attempt to act as though this function was never called.

Note:
   This is a new librsound function. To check if it's implemented, you can check for #ifdef RSD_EXEC

Example:
   rsd_start(handle);

   rsd_write(handle, buf, sizeof(buf));
   // ... Do some writing here.

   // Let's work with the metal!

   int fd = rsd_exec(handle);
   // Handle is now freed.

   write(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));

   // ... write some more

   close(fd);


rsd_exec() can also be used to make sure that all audio data in buffers will be written.

Example:
   rsd_stop(handle); // Might not flush buffers completely.
   rsd_free(handle); // Free handle here.

Example:
   close(rsd_exec(handle)); // Will close handle and write all data in buffers.


==================================
int rsd_stop(rsound_t* handle);
==================================

Description: 
   Disconnects from the server. This will drain all buffers, 
   and will not assure that all audio has been played back before returning.
   It shouldn't really fail, and if it happens for some reason, 
   there isn't much the programmer can or should do about it.

   If you want to make sure that all audio in buffers will be written, use
   rsd_exec(). See example.

Example:
rsd_stop(handle);


=================================================================
size_t rsd_write(rsound_t *handle, const void* buf, size_t size);
=================================================================

Params:
   handle - rsound handle
   buf - address of the buffer
   size - how many bytes to write

Description: 
   On an already started stream, write data to the internal buffer. 
   This is a blocking call,
   and will write everything before returning. 
   To determine how much data can be written without blocking, call rsd_get_avail(). 
   This call can fail if rsd_start() has not been called beforehand, or the connection to the server has suddenly
   been closed. Contrary to other rsd_* calls, this will return 0 when an error has been encountered, 
   else it will return the number of bytes written. 
   There is not need to call rsd_stop() if an error has been encountered. 
   The stream could directly be started again with rsd_start(), but if the connection is broken,
   this probably will not work anyways ;)

Example:
   char dummy[512] = {0};
   rsd_write(handle, dummy, sizeof(dummy));



=======================================
size_t rsd_pointer(rsound_t* handle);
=======================================

Description:
   Recieves the pointer of the internal buffer. E.g., if the buffer is empty, it will return 0, if it's full, 
   it will return the buffer size itself. Not very useful for a normal application. 
   Is mostly used when emulating different sound APIs that might query the sound card for the hardware pointer.

Example:
   size_t ptr = rsd_pointer(handle);

Note:
   This function is deprecated, and should not be used in new applications.


=======================================
size_t rsd_get_avail(rsound_t* handle);
=======================================

Description:
   Returns the amount of bytes that can be written to rsd_write() without blocking.



=====================================
size_t rsd_delay(rsound_t* handle);
=====================================

Description:
   Returns the current audio delay of the stream in terms of bytes. 
   The audio delay is measured as time it takes for a rsd_write() until the data written can be heard.
   Essential for A/V sync. Only call after rsd_start(). It is not guaranteed to be perfectly exact, but is a good estimate. Calling rsd_delay() right after rsd_start() returns the absolute minimum latency that can be achieved (but not guaranteed!).

Example:
   size_t delay = rsd_delay(handle);


=============================================
size_t rsd_delay_ms(rsound_t* handle);
=============================================

Description:
   Does essentially the same as rsd_delay(), but returns the delay in terms of milliseconds.

Example:
   size_t ms = rsd_delay_ms(rsound_t* handle);


=============================================
int rsd_samplesize(rsound_t* handle);
=============================================

Description:
Returns the size in bytes of the current sample format.

E.g. RSD_S16_LE will return 2, etc.

Example:
   int size = rsd_samplesize(handle);


========================================
void rsd_delay_wait(rsound_t* handle);
========================================

Description:
   This function might be slightly confusing. It is used to manually handle audio latencies, when it is desirable to obtain
   lower maximum latencies than the network buffers will give you. 
   It requires RSD_LATENCY to be set using rsd_set_param(), else this function will do nothing. 
   Do not expect that this function will magically give you a very low latency.
   Most applications should not use this function at all. 
   How low latency you can achieve with this method will greatly vary on how the network behaves, 
   and also on how accurate the server can measure latency from the audio drivers.

   To maintain a reasonably low latency for your audio, you should try to write in small chunks 
   and call rsd_delay_wait() before each call to rsd_write().

   In detail, this function will measure the current audio latency, and sleep until the latency is lower, 
   or equals the desired latency given in RSD_LATENCY.

Example:
   int max_delay = 150; // 150 ms
   rsd_set_param(handle, RSD_LATENCY, &max_delay);

   ... // Other initializing, rsd_start(), etc

   rsd_delay_wait(handle);
   rsd_write(handle, buf, size);



===============================================
int rsd_pause(rsound_t* handle, int enable);
===============================================

Params:
   handle - rsound handle
   enable - 1 will pause the stream, 0 will unpause

Description:
   This is basically a wrapper to rsd_start() and rsd_stop() currently.
   This function might be differently implemented in other implementations of rsound.
   Portability note: After pausing a stream, only valid calls that can follow this call are:
   rsd_stop() (stopping stream completely) or 
   rsd_pause(handle, 0) (unpausing). 
   Any different call is undefined.

=================================
int rsd_free(rsound_t* handle);
=================================

Description:
   Frees the rsound structure. Calling this function on a started stream is undefined behavior.
   Use rsd_stop() to close the stream before calling rsd_free(). 
   rsd_free() returns with an error code, but this can be ignored. It might fail if hell freezes over.



=====================================================
Documentation: RSound protocol
=====================================================

The RSound protocol is the rules that govern how the client and server communicate. 
The RSound protocol is connection oriented, but there is nothing wrong with implementing a 
connection-less interface in addition to TCP/IP. 
The RSound protocol mandates however, that at least a TCP/IP interface is present. 
The protocol is quite slim, and should not be difficult to implement in most systems.


The client shall maintain two connections to the server. 
The first connection is hereby referred to as the "data socket" and the second connection as the "control socket".

The server will accept two successive connections, 
and associate the first connection with the "data" and the second as "control".

When the connections are successful, the client will send a 44 byte RIFF WAVE header to the server on the data socket.
This WAVE header will include audio data information such as audio channels, audio format, and sample rate. 
For a pure WAVE header that only really supports S16_LE and U8 sample formats, 
the WAVE header that the client sends will be a conforming wave header if the audio formats are of type S16_LE and U8. 

For different audio formats, the wave header will signify this by settings the format bytes in the header to 0. 
These are bytes 20-21. You will then have to check bytes 42-43 to obtain the correct audio format. 
The format bytes will then have the same values as found in the rsound header files.
Do note that this value will be in little-endian format as well.

Should the format be either S16_LE or U8 we set the 20-21 bytes to 1. 
Then we can check the bits per sample to determine which sample format we have. 
For more information on the RIFF WAVE format, check some other documentation.


After the WAV header has been recieved at the server, it will send back a small header to the client, to determine the level of protocol support.

The server has now the opportunity to decide whether or not to support the control socket interface.
Old versions of rsound did not support this, but all new implementations should support it.

No support:
   The header will be 8 bytes.
Support:
   The header will be 16 bytes.

   The header is splitted into 2 or 4 unsigned 32-bit integers in network byte order (big-endian).

   Byte #   Description
   ====================================
   0-3         Initial audio driver latency. This will be the audio latency in bytes that the audio driver has. 
               This is typically quite low. 
               If this can't be measured in a reasonable way, the server can set this to 0.

   4-7         Network chunk size. If the server has any preferences on how large network packet sizes it wants, you can set this there.
               A sane default here for librsound is 512 bytes. The client is not forced to follow this suggestion, but it should.
               A server might set this chunk size equal the fragment size of the audio driver.

   8-11        This will always be 0. Later protocol revisions might use these values for something else.
   12-15       This will always be 0. Later protocol revisions might use these values for something else.

   The server can now decide to send only 8 bytes, or 16 bytes. The client will have to check if it can read 8 bytes, or 16 bytes
   from the network stream. If it can only read 8 bytes, writing to or reading from the control socket is undefined in this case.


Deprecated "8 byte" behavior:
==================================

After this initial handshaking has taken place, the client can send raw audio data to the server on the data socket. 
At this point, the server cannot send more data on the data socket, so it can safely be shut down with e.g. shutdown() accordingly.

The server shall read all data from the data socket and send this data to an "audio driver". 
How the server chooses to process this audio data is up to the implementation.

When the client decides to stop the data stream or the control stream, it will simply close() the sockets in question.
The server can drop the data in the network buffers if it chooses to. 



"16 byte" behavior:
==========================

If the control socket is enabled, the client can choose to send a message on the control socket, or audio data on the data socket.
The data socket will behave exactly as with the "8 byte" one, but we now have the control socket interface.
This sub-protocol will be explained in detail.


Control socket interface:
===========================

The client can issue commands to the server. This mini-protocol is currently very slim.

A client message consists of two parts.

[Header: 8 bytes][Body: variable, maximum 256]

The first 8 bytes will include the ascii magic key "RSD" and the following 5 bytes will embed a plain text integer 
which tells how many bytes the rest of the message consists of. 
The body will consist of:

space command space arg1 space arg2 ... 


The commands that the rsound protocol uses are:

NULL
STOP
INFO
IDENTITY
CLOSECTL

NULL: This is used for testing. It does not do anything. The server will not respond to the client in any way.
Example message: "RSD    5 NULL". Note that the body is 5 chars long since " NULL" is here the body (including the space). 
The '\0' byte associated with string termination in C is not included.


STOP: When the server recieves this, it closes down the control socket and data socket connection immediately. 
It does not send a reply back to the client.
Example message: "RSD    5 STOP".


INFO: The info command is used to measure latency. 
The client will send a message with an argument that represent the number of bytes written to the network since the start of the stream. 
This can be a fairly large number if the stream lasts for very long periods, so it's smart to use 64-bit integers here.

The client will send something along these lines:

"RSD   13 INFO 1532455"

The server must only respond to the latest latency requests in the network buffer. 
If several INFO requests are in the network buffer, disregard these, as they can no longer be reliable on measuring latency. 
INFO can be called on very often, and it is possible that INFO requests will pile up in the network buffer. 
Try to empty the network buffer each time the server does control handling.
If deemed appropriate, a server might ignore a request for INFO.

The server will take this message, and respond with appending the number of bytes actually played back to the speakers (or something similiar). 
To do this, the server could record number of bytes written to the audio driver and subtract the audio latency of the driver, 
effectively calculating the number of bytes "written" to the speakers. 
Note that this value should obviously _never_ be larger than the value recieved from the client. 
That is clearly a sign of having a full control socket network buffer, or buggy code somewhere in either library or otherwise. 
The server will then reply to the control socket with something like this:

"RSD   21 INFO 1532455 1502333"

When the client recieves this message, 
it can determine that there is a (1532455 - 1502333) delta between writing to the network before hearing it. 
Network latencies are assumed to be so small, that they aren't noticable. The protocol is not designed for perfectly accurate
latency measurements.


IDENTITY: This is used for the client to identity itself with a name. 
It is up to the server to show/log this message. The server does not respond to the client.
The server should not use this for any form of authentication.
Example message: "RSD   24 IDENTITY Example client"


CLOSECTL: When the server recieves this, the client will no longer use the control socket for anything, 
and closing down the socket on the client side should never make the server drop the data connection. The server can safely close the control socket. Before closing down the control socket, the server will respond to the client either with "CLOSECTL OK" or "CLOSECTL ERROR". This protocol call is used for rsd_exec().

Example:
   Recieves: 
   "RSD    9 CLOSECTL"

   Responds with: 
   "RSD   12 CLOSECTL OK" or
   "RSD   15 CLOSECTL ERROR"
