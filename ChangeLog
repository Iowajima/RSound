[RSound 0.9.0] - 2010-05-05:

- Bugfixes mostly


[RSound 0.9alpha] - 2010-04-15:

-  No ctl socket really needed. rsd will now ignore a missing ctl socket. 
-	Can netcat a riff wave file to rsd :)

-  Support for more sound formats. Now supports:
	-	S16LE
	-	S16BE
	-	U16LE
	-	U16BE
	-	U8
	-	S8

-	Support for anything else than S16LE and U8 is a bit hacky, 
	as the format specs need to be hacked in useless spots in the wave header.

- librsound now creates a valid RIFF header, making it easier to support on different audio systems.

- Cleanups.
