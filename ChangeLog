[RSound 0.9alpha] - 2010-04-15:

-  No ctl socket really needed. rsd will now ignore a missing ctl socket. 
   Can netcat a riff wave file to rsd :)

-  Support for more sound formats. Now supports:
   S16LE
   S16BE
   U16LE
   U16BE
   U8
   S8

   Support for anything else than S16LE and U8 is a bit hacky, 
   as the format specs need to be hacked in useless spots in the wave header.

- librsound now creates a valid RIFF header, making it easier to support on different audio systems.

- Cleanups.
