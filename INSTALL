==============
Dependencies:
==============

You will need at least one of these (headers and libraries):
   alsa-lib
   oss
   libao
   portaudio
   openal
   muroar
   pulseaudio

=========================
To compile (Unix-like):
=========================

Custom configure script, but will recognize some autotool-isms like --prefix, etc.
It will try to detect backend support.
To explicitly disable support, you can add these

--disable-alsa
--disable-oss
--disable-libao
--disable-portaudio
--disable-muroar
--disable-openal
--disable-pulse

You can refer to which modules you can (un)install by checking ./configure --help

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

======================
To compile (Cygwin):
======================

Windows is supported via:
   libao
   portaudio

The build process in cygwin is very similar. You will however need
to download, compile and install the latest portaudio and/or libao library 
in the cygwin environment, if this isn't provided by cygwin itself. 

Portaudio: http://www.portaudio.com/trac/wiki/TutorialDir/Compile/WindowsMinGW
LibAO: http://www.xiph.org/ao/ - Grab latest source and build as you would expect.

Then you could build with:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

and copy over rsd.exe and rsdplay.exe to where they might fit. To distribute
the applications you will need to include:

cyggcc_s-1.dll
cygportaudio-2.dll / cygao-2.dll
cygwin1.dll
