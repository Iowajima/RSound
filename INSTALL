Dependencies:

You will need at least one of these (headers and libraries):
   alsa-lib
   oss
   libao
   portaudio

To compile (Unix-like):

Standard autotools. It will try to detect backend support.
To explicitly disable support, you can add these

--disable-alsa
--disable-oss
--disable-libao
--disable-portaudio

$ ./configure --disable-things-here
$ make
# make install

To compile (Cygwin):

The build process in cygwin is very similar. You will however need
to download, compile and install the portaudio library in the cygwin
environment. http://www.portaudio.com/trac/wiki/TutorialDir/Compile/WindowsMinGW
Then you could build with

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

and copy over rsound.exe and rsoundserv.exe to where it might fit. To distribute
the applications you will need to include:

cyggcc_s-1.dll
cygportaudio-2.dll
cygwin1.dll
