To compile (Unix-like):

The configure script is a very simple ad hoc script.
To install, choose which backend(s) you want to add support for.
You will need to supply at least one of these to ./configure.

--enable-alsa: Needs libasound headers and library
--enable-oss: Only needs OSS.
--enable-libao: Needs libao headers and library
--enable-portaudio: Needs portaudio headers and library

$ ./configure --enable-things-here
$ make
# make PREFIX=$WHERE_YOU_WANT_TO_INSTALL install



To compile (Cygwin):

The build process in cygwin is very similar. You will however need
to download, compile and install the portaudio library in the cygwin
environment. http://www.portaudio.com/trac/wiki/TutorialDir/Compile/WindowsMinGW
Then you could build with

$ ./configure --enable-portaudio
$ make

and copy over rsound.exe and rsoundserv.exe to where it might fit. To distribute
the applications you will need to include:

cyggcc_s-1.dll
cygportaudio-2.dll
cygwin1.dll
