This package provides two programs.

rsd        -   The server which PCM data is streamed to over TCP/IP or Unix domain sockets, 
               sound is played back with a low latency depending on what backend is used.
               It supports several connections to be played back at the same time.


rsdplay    -   The client which streams PCM data recieved from stdin to a rsoundserv.
               The code in rsdplay is mostly for reference.


For integration with applications, librsound can be used.
