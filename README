This package provides two programs.

rsd -          The server which PCM data is streamed to over TCP/IP, 
               sound is played back with a low latency depending on what backend is used.
               It supports several connections to be played back at the same time.

rsdplay -      The client which streams PCM data recieved from stdin to a rsoundserv.
               The code in rsound is mostly for reference as the code can be implemented
               in many different applications.

For integration with applications, librsound can be used.

The package compiles and runs on the following platforms:

Unix-like - ALSA (Linux), OSS, libao, PortAudio (not recommended)
Microsoft Windows (Cygwin) - PortAudio only
(Mac OSX) - This is currently not tested, but the fact that PortAudio supports
            this platform makes it very likely that rsound will compile without
            any major problems.

On how to use these programs, refer to the --help in the respective programs.
