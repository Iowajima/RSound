This package provides two programs.

rsoundserv - 	The server which PCM data is streamed to over TCP/IP, 
					sound is played back with a low latency depending on what backend is used.
					It supports several connections to be played back at the same time.

rsound - 		The client which streams PCM data recieved from stdin to a rsoundserv.
					The code in rsound is mostly for reference as the code can be implemented
					in many different applications.

It is currently CLI based only, and because of its simple design,
it is mostly up to the user to find solutions on how to send audio
to an rsound client if used on the command line as is.


The package compiles and runs on the following platforms:

Unix-like - ALSA (Linux), OSS, libao, PortAudio (not recommended)
Microsoft Windows (Cygwin) - PortAudio only

On how to use these programs, refer to the --help in the respective programs.
